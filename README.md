## Topics for the Written Bachelor’s Exam

**June and September 2026**
**Specialization: Computer Science**

---

## Part 1. Algorithms and Programming

**Courses:** Fundamentals of Programming, Object-Oriented Programming, Data Structures

1.

Searching (sequential and binary), merging, sorting algorithms (selection sort, bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quicksort). Backtracking method.

2.

Algorithms in pseudocode. Algorithm complexity.

3.

OOP concepts in programming languages (Python, C++, Java, C#): Classes and objects. Class members and access specifiers. Constructors and destructors.

4.

Derived classes and inheritance. Method overriding. Polymorphism. Dynamic binding. Abstract classes and interfaces.

5.

UML class diagrams. Relationships between classes.

6.

Lists. Dictionaries. Binary search trees (excluding balanced binary search trees). Hash tables.

7.

Identifying appropriate data structures and data types for problem solving (only from those listed in point 6). Using existing libraries for these structures (Python, Java, C++, C#).

Exam subjects may include code written in Python, Java, C++, C#, or pseudocode.
Solutions may be required in Python, Java, C++, C#, or pseudocode.

## Part 3. Operating Systems

**Course:** Operating Systems

1. Unix file system structure.

2. Unix processes: creation; functions fork, exec, exit, wait; communication using pipes and FIFO.

3. Unix shell programming
   a. Basic concepts: variables, control structures
   (if/then/elif/else/fi, for/done, while/do/done, shift, break, continue),
   predefined variables ($0, $1, …, $9, $*, $@, $?),
   I/O redirection (|, >, >>, <, 2>, 2>>, 2>&1, the /dev/null file, backquotes ``)

   b. Extended regular expressions (POSIX ERE, supported by `grep -E` and `sed -E`)

   c. Basic commands (behavior and effect of specified arguments):
   cat, chmod (-R), cp (-r), cut (-d, -f), echo, expr, file,
   find (-name, -type), grep (-E, -i, -q, -v), head (-n), ls (-l),
   mkdir (-p), mv, ps (-e, -f), pwd, read (-p), rm (-f, -r),
   sed (-E and only commands d, s, y), sleep, sort (-n, -r), tail (-n),
   test (numeric, string, and file operators), true, uniq (-c),
   wc (-c, -l, -w), who

## Note

Subjects from the areas of Algorithms and Programming, Databases, and Operating Systems may include theory questions, problem-solving tasks, or multiple-choice questions with or without justification.
